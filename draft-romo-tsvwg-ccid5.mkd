--- abstract


DCCP communication is currently restricted to a single path per
connection, yet multiple paths often exist between peers.  The
simultaneous use of these multiple paths for a DCCP session could
improve resource usage within the network and, thus, improve user
experience through higher throughput and improved resilience to
network failures.
Use cases for a Multipath DCCP (MP-DCCP) are mobile devices (handsets, vehicles) and residential home gateways simultaneously connected to distinct paths as, e.g., 
a cellular link and a WiFi link
or to a mobile radio station and a fixed access network.  Compared to existing multipath protocols such as MPTCP, MP-DCCP provides specific support for non-TCP user
traffic as UDP or plain IP.  More details on potential use cases are provided in {{website}}, {{slide}} and {{paper}}.
All this use cases profit from an Open Source Linux reference implementation provided under {{website}}.

This document presents a set of extensions to
traditional DCCP to support multipath operation.  Multipath DCCP provides 
the ability to simultaneously use multiple
paths between peers.  The protocol offers
the same type of service to applications as DCCP and it provides the
components necessary to establish and use multiple DCCP flows across
potentially disjoint paths.
